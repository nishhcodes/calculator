# Calculator Web App

A simple yet functional calculator web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator performs basic arithmetic operations and supports chained calculations.

## 🚀 Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: **Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (x), Division (/)**
- Live display update
- Chained calculations (e.g., `4 + 2 - 3` continues without reset)
- Clear button to reset all values
- Error handling for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero)
- Sound effects on button clicks

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the calculator
